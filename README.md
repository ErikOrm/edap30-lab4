# Lab 4: Reinforcement Learning

This lab will go through some fundamental Reinforcement Learning algorithms on the classic problems BlackJack and FrozenLake. The entry point into this lab is `lab_part1`. The rest should be explained from there. There are also a number of auxilliary files that contains the environments, provide some plotting etc. 

Before starting, you will need two packages you might not have used before, `gymnasium` and `datasets`. 

```
pip install datasets
pip install "gymnasium[toy-text]"
```

If you are using Python <= 3.11, `gymnasium` was called `gym`, so you need to install that instead. This might also require some minor changes in the code. 

Enjoy and best of luck!
